<!-- Task 1: Create a homepage
Modify the route
Now modify the existing route that handles the homepage / request. Update this route to render the home.ejs template in response to a request.
When you refresh your browser, it should now be rendering the <h1> with the content Home Page.

Send data to view
Using the locals object, send the RESTAURANT data from server.js to the home.ejs view.

Using EJS tags, update your HTML to display the restaurant details. Include name, address, and phone.

Update the <title> of your home page to dynamically match the restaurant name.

Level-Up: Include conditional rendering to add the line “Yes we are open!” to the page if the restaurant isOpen, and “Sorry, we are closed.” otherwise.
